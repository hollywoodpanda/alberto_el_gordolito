# Alberto, el Gordolito
Trying to learn C with Vulkan / GLFW

{:toc}

## 1. Using it

- Run `make` to build it
- Run `./output/gordolito` on a linux machine. For windows, executing `.\output\gordolito.exe` should work, but probably won't.

## 2. Cleaning stuff

- Run `make clean` to clean the binaries
