# Alberto, el Gordolito
[Trying to learn C with Vulkan / GLFW using the 'Drawing a triangle' tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Setup/Base_code)


{:toc}

## 1. Using it

- Run `make` to build it
- Run `./output/gordolito` on a linux machine. For windows, executing `.\output\gordolito.exe` should work, but probably won't.

## 2. Cleaning stuff

- Run `make clean` to clean the binaries
